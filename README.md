# -Vestigialmars5/finances_app
This is my first real project I have a basic knowledge in python, html, css, javascript, bash and I'm starting react, git and github. I'm working on this project to test my skills and to build a portfolio for the future. I will be including api's, some backend and web design.
I'm also using this opportunity to play around with repositories, branches, etc. and getting used to git and github.

# --Project's description--
A personal money management website to keep track of your budget and expenses. It will include things to add your income or expenses to a certain category, fully costumizable as well as some insights of the spending habits.

# Contributing
If you happen to be reading this, feel free to contribute in any form ideas, comments, code, tips, tips in how to format this readme better Basically anything helps

# Current place
As of right now I'm only adding ideas to what I want in the project so everything is very messy and without the real text that will go in each tag. I decided to shift into a react project since I want a lot of moving parts without having to refresh the page all the time. So I created this new repository in which I rebased my project for a fresh start.

# Thank you
