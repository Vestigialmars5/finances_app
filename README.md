This is my first real project I have a basic knowledge in python, html, css, javascript, bash and I'm starting react. I'm working on this project to test my skills and to build a portfolio for the future.

#--Project's description--
This is a website that will help people manage their money by adding income and expenses 

#Contributing
If you happen to be reading this, feel free to contribute in any form Ideas, comments, code, tips, tips in how to format this readme better Basically anything helps

#Current place
As of right now I'm only adding ideas to what I want in the project so everything is very messy and without the real text that will go in each tag. I decided to shift into a react project since I want a lot of moving parts without having to refresh the page all the time. So I created this new repository in which I rebased my project for a fresh start.

#Thank you
